# Speech Recognition and Summarization system

I built a speech recognition and summarization system that can be used for automatically transcribing audio files, such as lecture notes, podcasts, or videos, and turning them into a short summary. 

I was able to accomplish these following items:
1. Build a speech recognizer to transcribe any audio files.
2. Add punctuation to the output of that recognizer.
3. A function that can convert long audio files into next.
4. Extract a summary of a long transcript.
5. Test the system on the available audio files and obtained fairly good results.
